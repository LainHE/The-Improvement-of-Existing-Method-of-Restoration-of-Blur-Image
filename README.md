### The-Improvement-of-Existing-Method-of-Restoration-of-Blur-Image


**Please use `UI.m` file to run the program.**</br>
Test images are in the folder of deblurring and qualityDetection.</br>
Please feel free to use those images to try the result.
#
The images in deblurring folder have marked the angle and length of motion blur on name.</br>
The first name means length, and second is angle -- which is opposite with the number show in GUI.</br>
The images in qualityDetection have marked it is target image or original image.</br>

`Program` **`WILL`** `create some files for detect in forDetect folder. You could delete them after runnning and testing.`
